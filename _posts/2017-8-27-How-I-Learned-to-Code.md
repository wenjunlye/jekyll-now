title: How I Learned to Code
---

I was wondering what my first blogpost should be, and I figured I should go in chronological order and talk about how I got started programming.

I think I was first exposed to programming when I was 11, and I had to use Microsoft Excel to solve one of my homework assignments. My teacher had mentioned that I might need to use Visual Basic to solve it, so I found a YouTube series on it and started learning it from there. I ended up not having to use it for the assignment, but I think being exposed to programming then contributed to my interest for programming later on.


## Codecademy and Cloud9

I hadn't really learnt anything while watching that YouTube series, because I never actually tried it for myself. The first time I got into the field a little more was at 13 when I started learning HTML and CSS from [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/). I got stuck on one of the sections, though, and didn't finish the course until about a year later. Afterwards, I learnt JavaScript on Codecademy as well. And then jQuery. And then Python.

Still, I hadn't really had much opportunities to make use of those skills outside of Codecademy, because I didn't  understand how these languages could be used in the real world. I didn't know how to create a webpage from HTML, how JavaScript could be used to add logic and interactivity to that webpage, or the kinds of environments I could use to create those things. Thankfully, one of the instructors who taught me in Infocomm Club that year introduced me to [Cloud9](https://c9.io/), an online development environment, and I started using it to practise my newfound coding skills. I also participated in a hackathon with my seniors in the club. That experience was very valuable in that I learned a lot about the web development, how to create web apps as well as how to collaborate with other programmers on a project.


## Telegram Bot Programming

In that year, I also started using the Telegram messaging app with my classmates. Telegram had created a platform for developers to easily create bots, and I wanted to make one as well. I chanced upon [this Telegram bot starter kit](https://github.com/yukuku/telebot) and used it to create a telegram bot for my class. It started out as a simple timetable bot, but over time I added a few more features to it.


## Infocomm Club

Being in Infocomm Club gave me many opportunities to participate in various programming courses, but those had their limitations. The instructors had to cater to the entire group of students when teaching and there were bound to be times when they were too fast or too slow for me. On top of that, the technologies we learnt didn't quite interest me as much as my own projects. Robotics for one, was immensely disinteresting and frustrating to me. The iOS App Development course was better and I managed to create one or two apps, but the Xcode development environment proved too overwhelming with its little red pop-ups with error messages about Swift 3 incompatibilities or something. That said, I am still incredibly grateful for all these experiences and exposure to different languages.

I would say that my main teacher has been the Internet. I've learnt most of the basics from Codecademy or other similar tutorial sites, but I believe I have come this far also through my own passion for programming. It is a strange, ever-burning passion that drives me to think up new projects for me to work on, and I have learnt much more through these projects than through Codecademy. It's been tough at times when there were bugs everywhere and nothing worked, but there were also times where I was so excited that I would continue to code past midnight. As a rather early sleeper, this would usually be very counter-productive, but as I've said, I have a strange, every-burning passion that compels me to do strange things.

It's been about two years since I first started programming, and I'm still making random webpages (check out my [portfolio](https://xlzior.github.io/portfolio/)!) and still adding new features to the telegram bot (for my new class this time). I looked at my conversation history with BotFather (Telegram's bot for developers to create bots; a.k.a. bot-ception) yesterday and found out that my first bot turned 2 years of age 4 days ago. I still find it amazing how far I've come since then, and I look forward to what I create next!
