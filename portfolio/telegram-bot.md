One of the main projects that I'm working on now is the Telegram Bot for my class. The bot can be accessed [here](https://telegram.me/threeoheight_bot).



## Features

### Timetable
The original role of the bot was to make it easier for us to find out the timetable. Most of us don't have our timetables saved on our phones, so this made it a lot more convenient for us to figure out what lessons we were having.

Our timetable is split into even weeks and odd weeks. To access the timetable, simply send the command "/[odd/even][day]"

Our class has students who take different humanities subjects. The bot tailors their responses to reflect that. Students can set their humanities subject using the command "/sethumans", and the bot will save it and send them a personalised timetable.

However, sometimes we forget whether this week is an even or odd week. That's where "/weekno" comes in.

We often only need to know the timetable for the next day. There's a command for that.

Sometimes, teachers set the deadline for homework as "the next lesson". The bot can help you find out when the next lesson of a certain subject is.

### Reminders
Now that the bot already has access to our timetable, why not let it remind us when we have certain lessons the next day? For example, we often forget to bring our PE attire on days when there are PE lessons. The bot sends a reminder to the class group chat the day before a PE lesson to remind us to pack for it. This also works for chemistry and biology lab experiments.

### Homework
How about homework? The bot can handle that too!

Retrieve the homework that's due using "/gethomework" or "/thisweek", which only returns the homework due in the next 7 days.

![thisweek]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/telegram-bot/thisweek.png)


Accidentally added a piece of homework, or the teacher decided not to collect it? Delete it using "/delhomework", which comes complete with a custom keyboard that lists out all the homework so you can choose which to delete.

### Birthdays
All these features have been very academically oriented... To add a little joy into student life, the bot remembers the birthdays of everyone in class and wishes them a happy birthday too!

The bot can also tell you whose birthday is upcoming next!

### Miscellaneous
Feeling down? Send "/cute" to the bot and be rewarded with a randomly selected image or gif.
