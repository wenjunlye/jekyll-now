### Inspiration
I participated in a course during CCA about iOS App Programming in Swift. During the course, we were tasked with designing and creating an app to practice our skills.

As a Geography student who once spent an hour on Google Maps looking for river features I had learnt about during lessons, I decided to create an app which would allow me to jump to the maps of a few famous rivers and coasts.

I also added some other features such as a flash cards section to revise the definitions of different features as well as a section for school notes.
